    "Proj1": "Rust implementation of the diffusers API, equivalent to huggingface's diffusers. Based on the tch-rs crate, the implementation is complete enough so as to be able to run Stable Diffusion v1.5 and v2.1. Main open-source contributor.",
    "Proj2": "High-performance header-only C++20 library for bayesian inference on discrete bayesian networks, supporting both CPU and GPU implementations (Cuda and OpenCL) of inference algorithms and copy-on-write (CoW) memory optimizations.",
    "Proj3": "Python toolkit for quantum machine learning, developed on top of Qiskit, offers well-known supervised and unsupervised machine learning implementations for a gated quantum computer. Winner of a University award for best project.",
    "Proj4": "Personal website portfolio for professional usage. Built with React, NodeJS and ❤️. Highly customizable and easy to use.",
